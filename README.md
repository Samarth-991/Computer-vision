# Computer-vision
Notebooks for advanced computer vision based algorithms.These algorithms are realated to variious Image processing techniques as well as various GAN networks on real dataset to re-create images or even dataset.
# Super-Resolution
Image super-resolution (SR) is the process of recovering high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images. It is an important class of image processing techniques in computer vision and image processing and enjoys a wide range of real-world applications, such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, surveillance and security, astronomical imaging, amongst others.

# De-Bluring with Autoencoders 
Auto-Encoders are used to take an input image and then store the details of that image into a different format whose size is smaller than the size of the image. These stored details can then later be used to recreate either the same image or a different image based upon the input image. Auto-Encoders is the fundamental concept behind image recreation as well as generating new images and hence, are used in many General Adversarial Networks as well.

# Image to Image Translation Networks
Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims at learning a joint distribution of images in different domains by using images from the marginal distributions in individual domains. More Details at

# De-Noising with UNET and VGG-UNET  
Solving the task of Image segmentation , we use UNET architecture to create models which perform semantic segmentation.More info is availble at https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-semantic-segmentation-with-unet-6be4f42d4b47 . De-Noising is one such task where we are focusing on improving the image quality by using UNET-Architecture to resolve the problem of Noising in images.
